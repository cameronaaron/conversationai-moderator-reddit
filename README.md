This repository contains two tools that use the [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/) to help with the moderation of reddit comments:

1. **discourse**: (TODO - one sentence summary)
2. **perspective_bot**: A reddit bot that can stream comments from a subreddit, score them via the [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/), and perform a range of moderation actions based on the score rules.
